It implements an SNTP client. In contrast to NTP implementations such as chrony or the NTP reference server this only implements a client side, and does not bother with the full NTP complexity, focusing only on querying time from one remote server and synchronizing the local clock to it. The daemon runs with minimal privileges, and has been hooked up with networkd to only operate when network connectivity is available. The daemon saves the current clock to disk every time a new NTP sync has been acquired, and uses this to possibly correct the system clock early at bootup, in order to accommodate for systems that lack an RTC such as the Raspberry Pi and embedded devices, and make sure that time monotonically progresses on these systems, even if it is not always correct. To make use of this daemon a new system user and group \"systemd-timesync\" needs to be created on installation of systemd.

The mount (and umount) system call controls the mounting and unmounting of file systems. The parameters below configure the system to create an audit record when the mount system call is used by a non-privileged user. Note: - This tracks successful and unsuccessful mount commands. File system mounts do not have to come from external media and this action still does not verify write (e.g. CD ROMS). - Reloading the auditd config to set active settings requires the auditd service to be restarted, and may require a system reboot.","rationale":"It is highly unusual for a non privileged user to mount file systems to the system. While tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful open, creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track data export to media is beyond the scope of this document.","remediation":"For 32 bit systems Edit or create a file in the /etc/audit/rules.d/ directory ending in .rules Example: vi /etc/audit/rules.d/50-mounts.rules Add the following lines: -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k mounts For 64 bit systems Edit or create a file in the /etc/audit/rules.d/ directory ending in .rules Example: vi /etc/audit/rules.d/50-mounts.rules Add the following lines: -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k mounts -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k mounts","compliance":{"cis":"4.1.12","cis_csc_v7":"5.1","cmmc_v2":{"0":"AC.1.002,CM.2.061,SC.3.180"},"iso_27001-2013":"A.8.1.3,A.14.2.5","mitre_techniques":"T1110,T1003,T1081,T1097,T1178,T1072,T1067,T1495,T1019,T1177,T1485,T1486,T1491,T1488,T1487,T1490,T1146,T1148,T1015,T1133,T1200,T1076,T1051,T1176,T1501,T1087,T1098,T1139,T1197,T1092,T1136,T1011,T1147,T1130,T1174,T1053,T1166,T1206,T1503,T1214,T1187,T1208,T1142,T1075,T1201,T1145,T1184,T1537,T1078,T1077,T1134,T1017,T1088,T1175,T1190,T1210,T1525,T1215,T1086,T1055,T1505,T1035,T1218,T1169,T1100,T1047,T1084,T1028,T1156,T1196,T1530,T1089,T1073,T1157,T1054,T1070,T1037,T1036,T1096,T1034,T1150,T1504,T1494,T1489,T1198,T1165,T1492,T1080,T1209,T1112,T1058,T1173,T1137,T1539,T1535,T1506,T1138,T1044,T1199","nist_sp_800-53":"AU-2,CM-1,CM-2,CM-6,CM-7,IA-5,IA-6,SC-20,SC-21","pci_dss_v3":{"2":{"1":"2.2"}}},"directory":["/etc/audit"],"result":"failed"}}},"location":"sca"}

It implements an SNTP client. In contrast to NTP implementations such as chrony or the NTP reference server this only implements a client side, and does not bother with the full NTP complexity, focusing only on querying time from one remote server and synchronizing the local clock to it. The daemon runs with minimal privileges, and has been hooked up with networkd to only operate when network connectivity is available. The daemon saves the current clock to disk every time a new NTP sync has been acquired, and uses this to possibly correct the system clock early at bootup, in order to accommodate for systems that lack an RTC such as the Raspberry Pi and embedded devices, and make sure that time monotonically progresses on these systems, even if it is not always correct. To make use of this daemon a new system user and group \"systemd-timesync\" needs to be created on installation of systemd.

The mount (and umount) system call controls the mounting and unmounting of file systems. The parameters below configure the system to create an audit record when the mount system call is used by a non-privileged user. Note: - This tracks successful and unsuccessful mount commands.

While tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful open, creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track data export to media is beyond the scope of this document.","remediation":"For 32 bit systems Edit or create a file in the /etc/audit/rules.d/ directory ending in .rules Example: vi /etc/audit/rules.d/50-mounts.rules Add the following lines: -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k mounts For 64 bit systems Edit or create a file in the /etc/audit/rules.d/ directory ending in .rules Example: vi /etc/audit/rules.d/50-mounts.rules Add the following lines: -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k mounts -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k mounts","compliance":{"cis":"4.1.12","cis_csc_v7":"5.1","cmmc_v2":{"0":"AC.1.002,CM.2.061,SC.3.180"},"iso_27001-2013":"A.8.1.3,A.14.2.5","mitre_techniques":"T1110,T1003,T1081,T1097,T1178,T1072,T1067,T1495,T1019,T1177,T1485,T1486,T1491,T1488,T1487,T1490,T1146,T1148,T1015,T1133,T1200,T1076,T1051,T1176,T1501,T1087,T1098,T1139,T1197,T1092,T1136,T1011,T1147,T1130,T1174,T1053,T1166,T1206,T1503,T1214,T1187,T1208,T1142,T1075,T1201,T1145,T1184,T1537,T1078,T1077,T1134,T1017,T1088,T1175,T1190,T1210,T1525,T1215,T1086,T1055,T1505,T1035,T1218,T1169,T1100,T1047,T1084,T1028,T1156,T1196,T1530,T1089,T1073,T1157,T1054,T1070,T1037,T1036,T1096,T1034,T1150,T1504,T1494,T1489,T1198,T1165,T1492,T1080,T1209,T1112,T1058,T1173,T1137,T1539,T1535,T1506,T1138,T1044,T1199","nist_sp_800-53":"AU-2,CM-1,CM-2,CM-6,CM-7,IA-5,IA-6,SC-20,SC-21","pci_dss_v3":{"2":{"1":"2.2"}}},"directory":["/etc/audit"],"result":"failed"}}},"location":"sca"}

It implements an SNTP client. In contrast to NTP implementations such as chrony or the NTP reference server this only implements a client side, and does not bother with the full NTP complexity, focusing only on querying time from one remote server and synchronizing the local clock to it. The daemon runs with minimal privileges, and has been hooked up with networkd to only operate when network connectivity is available. The daemon saves the current clock to disk every time a new NTP sync has been acquired, and uses this to possibly correct the system clock early at bootup, in order to accommodate for systems that lack an RTC such as the Raspberry Pi and embedded devices, and make sure that time monotonically progresses on these systems, even if it is not always correct. To make use of this daemon a new system user and group \"systemd-timesync\" needs to be created on installation of systemd.

Monitoring /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net is important, as intruders could put disinformation into those files and trick users into providing information to the intruder.

The mount (and umount) system call controls the mounting and unmounting of file systems. The parameters below configure the system to create an audit record when the mount system call is used by a non-privileged user. Note: - This tracks successful and unsuccessful mount commands.

While tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful open, creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track data export to media is beyond the scope of this document.","remediation":"For 32 bit systems Edit or create a file in the /etc/audit/rules.d/ directory ending in .rules Example: vi /etc/audit/rules.d/50-mounts.rules Add the following lines: -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k mounts For 64 bit systems Edit or create a file in the /etc/audit/rules.d/ directory ending in .rules Example: vi /etc/audit/rules.d/50-mounts.rules Add the following lines: -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k mounts -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k mounts","compliance":{"cis":"4.1.12","cis_csc_v7":"5.1","cmmc_v2":{"0":"AC.1.002,CM.2.061,SC.3.180"},"iso_27001-2013":"A.8.1.3,A.14.2.5","mitre_techniques":"T1110,T1003,T1081,T1097,T1178,T1072,T1067,T1495,T1019,T1177,T1485,T1486,T1491,T1488,T1487,T1490,T1146,T1148,T1015,T1133,T1200,T1076,T1051,T1176,T1501,T1087,T1098,T1139,T1197,T1092,T1136,T1011,T1147,T1130,T1174,T1053,T1166,T1206,T1503,T1214,T1187,T1208,T1142,T1075,T1201,T1145,T1184,T1537,T1078,T1077,T1134,T1017,T1088,T1175,T1190,T1210,T1525,T1215,T1086,T1055,T1505,T1035,T1218,T1169,T1100,T1047,T1084,T1028,T1156,T1196,T1530,T1089,T1073,T1157,T1054,T1070,T1037,T1036,T1096,T1034,T1150,T1504,T1494,T1489,T1198,T1165,T1492,T1080,T1209,T1112,T1058,T1173,T1137,T1539,T1535,T1506,T1138,T1044,T1199","nist_sp_800-53":"AU-2,CM-1,CM-2,CM-6,CM-7,IA-5,IA-6,SC-20,SC-21","pci_dss_v3":{"2":{"1":"2.2"}}},"directory":["/etc/audit"],"result":"failed"}}},"location":"sca"}
